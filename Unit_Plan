# Abstractions, Algorithms and Lists
by Victoria Berkowitz and Stephannia Kabanakis

-----

## General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

* Abstraction
* Introduction to Lists (What is a list? List methods and indices)
* List Programming
* Algorithms (What is an algorithm and where do we use them in our every day lives?)
---

## Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
* We created this unit because we feel that abstraction pairs well with lists. 
* We also added in algorithms as we get more into the idea that computers take specific instructions and being clear and direct is a neccessity. 
* After learning strings, students will have many more opportunities to practice programming and interact with the previous lesson of variables as well.
* Including algorithms will help better prepare students with the concepts of procedures and help tie this unit into the next.
