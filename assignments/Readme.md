## Worksheet Assignments

### List Practice Worksheet 1
* This worksheet pairs the APCSP Reference Sheet with list coding problems to solve. It scaffolds and spirals the work to help students better understand and utilize the APCSP Reference sheet.
### List Practice Worksheet 2
* This worksheet has no APCSP reference sheet built in, but is instead used as practice to help students get comfortable with lists and manipulating them.
### Practice AP Questions
* This assignment is full of AP-styled questions to help students practice and show off their knowledge at the end of the unit.

## Coding Assignments

### Hatch List Practice
In the Hatch app, practice using list indices by writing a program that completes the tasks below:

Tasks:

To complete each task, you must use the indices from the list.

Create a List:
Use the following list in your code,

**List Name: Color**

**List Items:**
* red
* orange
* yellow
* green
* blue
* purple

**Add to a List:**
* Ask the user to enter another color name
* Ask the user to enter an index to insert the color at
* Insert the new color at that index

**Remove from a List:**
* Ask the user to enter an index number to remove from the list
* Remove that color from the list.

**Accessing Value in a list:**
* Have the sprite say the first color in the list.
* Have the sprite say the last color in the list.
* Have the sprite day the 4th color in the list.

### Hatch Wish List
* **This assignment gives students some code that already has the list created for them**
* Add 2 items to your list 
* This can be anything you would like to buy such as food, games, etc.
* Ask the user what item they would like to add to the wish list. Add this to the list.
* Repeat 3 times
* Tell the user that the first item in your list is out of stock.
* Ask the user what item they would like to replace the first item with.
* Then replace the first item with the item the user input.
* Have your sprite tell the user how long the list it.
* Use a complete sentence.
* Hint: Use the join block and the length of block.


### Hatch Number List
* You will only need to change the set blocks here to hold the proper values.
* Follow the sum example
* Find the difference between the 3rd and 4th elements/item of numberList and assign it to the variable named difference
* Find the quotient of the last and 1st elements of numberList and assign it to the variable named quotient
* Find the product of the 2nd and 3rd elements of numberList and assign it to the variable named product
* Perform MOD on the 2nd and 4th element and assign it to the variable named mod
