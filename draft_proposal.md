# Unit Plan Draft Proposal

## Name: Unit 2 - Abstractions
## Contributors: Victoria Berkowitz and Stephannia Kabanakis
## Language: Hatch! (Block-based coding)
## Description:
This unit covers the following topics:
* Abstraction
* Introduction to Lists (What is a list? List methods and indices)
* List Programming
* Algorithms (What is an algorithm and where do we use them in our every day lives?)
## Rationale:
* We created this unit because we feel that abstraction pairs well with lists. 
* We also added in algorithms as we get more into the idea that computers take specific instructions and being clear and direct is a neccessity. 
* After learning strings, students will have many more opportunities to practice programming and interact with the previous lesson of variables as well.
* Including algorithms will help better prepare students with the concepts of procedures and help tie this unit into the next.
* We have removed strings from this unit because we plan to have it covered in unit 1 by having students practice with displaying variables and string concatenation.
## Progression:
* Abstraction: We will go over abstraction, what it is, and how it is used in our everyday lives. We plan on using the names example (how names for people are abstractions) and tie this into the idea of variables as abstractions. This lesson on abstraction will also cover dynamic and static project vocabulary as well as tie in these concepts to the Create Performance Task portions of the APCSP Exam. We plan on giving students their first taste of the CPT by giving them already working code and having them answer questions about the code similar to the CPT, but focused on variables(because they will be finishing their unit on variables the lesson before this.)
* Introduction to Lists: We plan to go over lists in everyday lives, review simple list vocab(list, element, index, length). We then will cover different list methods in Hatch! and what they look like. After, we plan to give an offline activity where we create a wish list as a class. Then we will ask students to alter the list based on a set of instructions. We will review each instruction and model to students how the changes occured.
* List Programming: We will give students 2-3 coding challenges on lists to help them practice interacting with lists. This is to get them comfortable with list methods and creating code on their own that will be appropriate for the CPT.
* Algorithms: We will go over what an algorithm is and relate algorithms to the real world. We plan on showing a video with a dad asking his kids to make instructions for him to make a PBJ sandwich. We then plan on doing an offline task to have students write instructions to make a paper airplane. What happens when they give these instructions to another group? We will then review some vocab on sequencing, iteration, and selection by pointing to where these exist in a code snippet. This will help tie our students into the next lesson of procedures and help prime them for writing clear and direct instructions.
## Placement:
* This unit is placed after a unit on variables and before a unit on procedures.
* The unit on variables went over variable types, declaration and assignment, input and ouput, along with math expressions.
* The unit on procedures goes over procedures, what they are, how to write them, and practice writing them.
