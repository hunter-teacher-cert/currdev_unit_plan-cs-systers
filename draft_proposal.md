# Unit Plan Draft Proposal

## Name: Unit 2 - Abstractions
## Description:
This unit covers the following topics:
* Abstraction
* Introduction to Lists (What is a list? List methods and indices)
* List Programming
* Strings (What is a string? Concatenation, subtring, String methods)
## Rationale:
* We created this unit because we feel that abstraction pairs well with lists which also tie into Strings.
* After learning strings, students will have many more opportunities to practice programming and interact with the previous lesson of variables as well.
## Placement:
* This unit is placed after a unit on variables and before a unit on procedures.
* The unit on variables went over variable types, declaration and assignment, input and ouput, along with math expressions.
* The unit on procedures goes over procedures, what they are, how to write them, and practice writing them.
